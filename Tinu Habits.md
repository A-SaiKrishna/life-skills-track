# Tiny Habits
## 1.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
I like the formula B = MAT and its graph. MAT stands for Motivation, Ability and Trigger. It tells that motivation may not stand for long by using tiny habits one can move forward and change the behaviour for long. Triggers a play a role.

## 2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
* M - Motivation.
* A - Ability.
* P - Prompt.
We may not achieve big habits as behaviour, however we can practice it's tiny version daily. By using the "After I <some_task>, I will <tiny_habit>" by using this type of triggers one can achieve anything. Small is successfull and sustainable.

## 3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
The main motto in this is it automatically increases one's confidence and motivation. It means like self encouragment.

## 4.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
There are four stages like Noticing, Wanting, Doing and Liking. In this in doinjg we need to start over and over again, optimise the starting line. We need to keep in mind that good habit's rewards are delayed.

## 5.What is the book's perspective about Identity?
We need adopt a *habit* such that it become part of identity. Goals restrict our happiness. 


## 6.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
Compounds of small decisions gives big result. Rather looking for big tasks chunk down to small habits and achieve them repetedly. Even *environmental design* also helps in building the habits.


## 7.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
It need to follow the following steps

## 8.Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
* I like to build a habit of doing 3 coding questions on DSA.
* To achieve this leetcode contains daily streaks, planning to maintain the daily streak.
